Radix Sort Algorithm
The key idea behind Radix Sort is to exploit the concept of place value. It assumes that sorting numbers digit by digit will eventually result in a fully sorted list. Radix Sort can be performed using different variations, such as Least Significant Digit (LSD) Radix Sort or Most Significant Digit (MSD) Radix Sort.
